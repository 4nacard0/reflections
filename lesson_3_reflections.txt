When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Because I want to have an online backup of my code or because I'm working in a team and this way we all share the same repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I want to have full control of the changes that are part of the official version of the code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is only available on Github, in fact, is the way Github performs a clone. Clone is used to get locally a remote repository. Branch is the way to create a new version of the code from a certain point.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    I don't know

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It would be harder to compare changes from different collaborators.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When I'm developing a new feature, for example.
