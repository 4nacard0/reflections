How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    With diff tool is much easier to find the differences than manually. 
    It points you directly to those lines in the file that have changed from one file to another.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It saves time finding a bug in the code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros is that changes are controlled logically by me. The cons is I have
    to remember myselef when a commit must be made and automatically would be 
    easier for me.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because at programming, a logical change implies changes in several files that
    are needed for the program to work.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives you the history of every commit made in the repository. git diff
    lets you compare two commits, showing the differences between each version.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you can go back to some previous version when everything worked ok.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use git for coding development.
